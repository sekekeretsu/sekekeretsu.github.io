        Title: Discovery of small molecules and dinucleotide analogs as STING agonist for cancer immunotherapy.
      </h1>
      <hr>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Immune evasion via T cell exhaustion, secretion of immunosuppressive mediators and expression of proteins that
        modulate immune checkpoint, is a well-established hallmark for cancer (1). T cell infiltration to the tumor
        microenvironment has been considered to be a prerequisite for an efficient response to immunotherapeutic
        treatment (2,3). Hence, redirecting the immune response to the tumor microenvironment has been considered an
        important therapeutic route for cancer treatment (2).
      </p>
      <p>
        The enzyme cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) detects cytoplasmic self DNA or tumor-derived DNA and generates the
        secondary messenger cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate–Adenosine Monophosphate (cGAMP) (4). cGAMP binds to the
        stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and activates it. STING then recruits tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and
        activates interferon regulatory factor (IRF3) which triggers a cascade of downstream signaling events responsible
        for activation and infiltration of T cells into the tumor microenvironment and promotes antitumor responses.
        Hence, STING agonists with the potential to induce immune response are promising drug candidates for cancer (2,5,6).
      </p>
      <p>
        The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanism of STING activation by its endogenous ligand cGAMP
        at the molecular level and to develop novel STING agonists using state-of-the-art computer-aided drug design
        (CADD) techniques such as molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, classical molecular
        dynamics (MD) and binding energy calculation (7–9).

      <hr>

      <p><strong>Aim 1: To determine the mechanism of activation of STING by the endogenous cyclic dinucleotide 2’, 3’-cGAMP.</strong></p>
      <p>
        The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
        Previous studies have shown how 2’, 3’-cGAMP interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the STING dimer. However,
        the mechanism of how 2’, 3’-cGAMP binding leads to activation of STING and the downstream signaling events that
        follow is unknown. Comparative studies of the STING dimer in apo state and in the 2’, 3’-cGAMP bound state could
        reveal essential conformational changes and key residues involved in activation.
      </p>
      <p>
        All-atom classical MD simulations of apo-STING and STING–cGAMP (Figure 1B) will be performed to study dynamic
        interactions at the binding interface and 2’, 3’-cGAMP induced conformational changes in STING. This will be
        followed by MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations to study binding affinities and identify residues important
        for binding (8). The cryo-EM structure of apo human STING (PDB 6NT5) and the cGAMP–STING complex (PDB 4KSY) will
        be used (10,11). Missing residues will be modeled. Simulations and binding energy calculations will be performed
        using GROMACS and g_mmpbsa (7,8).
      </p>

      <p><strong>Aim 2: To develop novel hydrolysis resistant nucleotidic STING agonists.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Natural cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and derivatives have demonstrated promising antitumor activity and
        immunostimulating effects in vitro and in vivo. However, they are poor drug candidates due to instability and
        high polarity. CDNs contain phosphodiester bonds that are negatively charged and susceptible to hydrolysis by
        enzymes such as phosphodiesterase (2,12).
      </p>
      <p>
        The CDN 2’, 3’-cGAMP is a heterodimer linked by one 3’-5’-phosphodiester and one 2’-5’-phosphodiester and is the
        most potent STING agonist in humans (Figure 1C), with a dissociation constant of 4.59 nM (13). Starting from
        cGAMP, hydrolysis-resistant analogs will be designed to mimic key interactions with STING by substituting linker
        moieties for phosphodiester bonds (Figure 1D). Molecular docking will evaluate binding interactions; binding
        affinities will be iteratively assessed using all-atom MD simulations and binding energy calculations (14).
      </p>

      <p><strong>Aim 3: To discover small molecules from publicly available databases with virtual screening.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Based on Aim 1, key interactions important for STING activation will be identified. Pharmacophore models will be
        developed to search for small molecules that bind and activate STING. This will be followed by docking to
        evaluate binding affinity. Promising compounds will be studied further using classical MD simulations and free
        energy calculations (14). Compounds from databases such as ZINC (15) or ChEMBL (16) will be used. Hits may be
        tested by experimental collaborators for antitumor activity.
      </p>

      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Immunotherapy has emerged as a remarkable pharmaceutical approach to mitigate previously untreatable tumors and
        metastatic cancers via immune checkpoint blockade and antitumor T cell responses. However, a drawback is
        non-immunogenic tumors that fail to elicit T cell responses (2). T cell infiltration into the tumor
        microenvironment can indicate effective response to immunotherapeutic treatment (3). Hence, strategies that
        promote T cell infiltration may improve antitumor activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway is a key innate immune signaling pathway (Figure 1A) (17). Cytoplasmic DNA triggers
        cGAS to generate cGAMP (2’,3’-cGAMP in humans). cGAMP binds STING, inducing conformational changes that lead to
        activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, promoting T cell infiltration
        and immune response. STING is thus a promising target for antitumor drugs and vaccine adjuvants (5,13).
      </p>
      <p>
        While structural understanding has progressed, several aspects of STING activation remain unresolved—especially
        how cGAMP binding leads to activation. Multiple nucleotidic STING agonists have been developed; however, many
        have limited stability and susceptibility to hydrolysis (12). Developing stable nucleotide-based STING agonists
        remains a key challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        DMXAA showed anti-tumor activity in mouse models but failed clinically due to lack of activity on human STING (22).
        Several small molecules have been reported as STING agonists (23,24), but no non-nucleotidic STING agonists are
        currently in clinical trials (2).
      </p>

      <h2>Innovation</h2>
      <p>
        Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) methods are powerful tools frequently used alongside experimental methods.
        Computational approaches can help uncover mechanisms of STING activation and aid discovery of STING agonists.
        With growing literature and availability of full-length cryo-EM structures of apo-STING and cGAMP–STING (human),
        computational study of STING presents an opportunity to develop agonists targeting the cGAS–STING–IRF3 pathway.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is designed to study the binding mechanism of STING and 2’,3’-cGAMP and to design hydrolysis-resistant
        STING agonists. Potential hits may be tested by experimental collaborators. Although computationally intensive,
        advances in GPU hardware and MD software make long-timescale simulation more feasible. The proposed study uses
        standard drug discovery methods including docking, simulation, binding energy calculations, and pharmacophore-based
        virtual screening.
