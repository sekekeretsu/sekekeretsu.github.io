This includes ongoing research projects as well as other interest of mine that I inended to pursue in the near future. This works can be broadly classified into the application and development oriented projects </p>

	This part will be updated from time to time

Recent studies on GPCR proteins and CRISPR-CAS9 systems have demonstrated that GaMD techniques could be effectively used to study the binding and activation mechanisms of large biomolecular systems. I am curious to find out if these enhanced sampling techniques can be used to resolve existing structural enigmas in the areas of GPCR proteins such as Serotonin receptors.
