    This study investigates astrocyte–immune cell interactions using an integrated multi-omics approach, combining transcriptomic, spatial transcriptomic/proteomics
         and spatial analyses to define cellular crosstalk within the Glioblastoma tumor microenvironment.

            <h2 class="section-title">Characterizing MAIT cells in Glioblastoma</h2>

       <p>
We used TCR sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and multiplex tissue imaging with CODEX to investigate the role of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in glioblastoma (GBM). Our study demonstrated that MAIT cells are present within GBM tumor tissue and are associated with immunosuppressive myeloid cells. Survival analysis of the TCGA-GBM dataset showed that increased MAIT cell abundance correlates with poor patient survival. Functional studies further suggest that MAIT cells may exert an immunosuppressive role through IL-17 signaling.    </p>

          <h3>Highlight of the study:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The expression level of MAIT signature genes correlates with the poor survival of GBM patients</li>
    <li>MAIT17 cells are a predominant MAIT functional subset in GBM tumors</li>
    <li>MAIT cells play immunosuppressive roles in GBM through TANs</li>
    </ul>

      <h2 class="section-title"> Computational study of serotonin receptors (GPCR)</h2>
      <figure>
        <img class="hero-img" src="membrane.jpg" alt="Membrane illustration related to GPCR research" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        Recent studies on GPCR proteins and CRISPR-CAS9 systems have demonstrated that GaMD techniques could be
        effectively used to study the binding and activation mechanisms of large biomolecular systems. I am curious
        to find out if these enhanced sampling techniques can be used to resolve existing structural enigmas in the
        areas of GPCR proteins such as serotonin receptors.

        Virtual screening of MEROPS (a protease database) for potential COVID-19 main protease (SARS-CoV-2)
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the fast-evolving coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, repurposing existing drugs and evaluating
        commercially available inhibitors against druggable targets could be an effective strategy to accelerate
        drug discovery. The 3C-Like proteinase (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as an important drug target
        due to its role in viral replication. The availability of the X-ray crystal structure of 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6LU7)
        motivated us to perform a computational study to identify commercially available potential inhibitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        A combination of modeling studies was performed to identify potential 3CLpro inhibitors from the protease
        inhibitor database MEROPS (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops/index.shtml). We found 15 potential 3CLpro inhibitors
        with higher binding affinity than the inhibitor in the X-ray structure (α-ketoamide). Among them, Saquinavir
        (an approved HIV-1 drug) and investigational drugs such as aclarubicin, TMC-310911, and faldaprevir were
        suggested as potential 3CLpro inhibitors.

        Modelling study of Nanobody binding to Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor (AT1R) and virtual screening of AT1R inhibitors
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT1R) have emerged as an important G Protein-Coupled
        Receptor (GPCR) because of the role it plays in regulating cardiovascular and renal activities. Consequently,
        inhibitors that target AT1R are considered therapeutic agents for heart failure diseases. However, computational
        studies of AT1R–G protein interactions have not been studied due to the oversized system that incurs high
        computational cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proposal was designed to study the coupling mechanism of ligand binding to AT1R and the conformational
        changes leading to stabilization and activation of AT1R using Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD).
        In addition, a docking-based virtual screening protocol was proposed to identify potential AT1R antagonists
        from the ZINC database. Binding free energy evaluation of selected ligands will be performed using MM-PBSA.
        The outcome could provide useful insight into the mechanism of AT1R activation and may assist in discovery of
        AT1R antagonists.

      <h2 class="section-title">Data mining in PPI networks</h2>
      <p>
        I have worked in the area of data mining in biological networks under the project entitled,
        “Protein complex identification in protein-protein interaction networks with the incorporation of gene
        expression profile,” supervised by Dr. Rosy Sarmah, Tezpur University. The study culminated in the development
        of new bioinformatics methods that showed statistically better protein complex prediction. The Java
        implementations of the methods are available at:
        <br>
        http://agnigarh.tezu.ernet.in/~rosy8/shared.html

      <h2 class="section-title">Mechanism of STING agonism</h2>
      <p>
        The transmembrane protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an important component of the immune
        signalling pathway and its activation has been shown to elevate immune response in tumour cancers. Hence,
        STING agonists are of vital pharmaceutical importance for cancer immunotherapy. My research proposal titled
        “Discovery of small molecules and dinucleotide analogs as STING agonist for cancer immunotherapy” was designed
        to study the mechanism of activation of STING and to develop small molecules and hydrolysis-resistant
        dinucleotide STING agonists.
      </p>
      <p>
        The study will involve protein modeling, molecular docking and simulation, binding energy calculations and
        virtual screening of chemical compounds. It may also be carried out in collaboration with experimental partners.
