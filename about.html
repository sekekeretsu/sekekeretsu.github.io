I am a Ph.D. student in bioinformatics at the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea, and I am scheduled to graduate in February 2021. I am trained in various molecular modeling techniques such as protein modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, enhanced sampling techniques, free energy calculation, virtual screening, and 3D quantitative structure-activity relationships (3D-QSAR) analysis. I have a master's degree in Information Technology from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tezpur University, India with a specialization in bioinformatics. My master’s degree dissertation was on the project title, “identification of protein complexes in protein-protein interaction networks incorporating gene expression profile,” where I have used unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify protein complexes from PPI networks. I have also implemented the methods conceptualized in my dissertation using java API. The implemented codes are available at http://agnigarh.tezu.ernet.in/~rosy8/shared.html. Over the years I have acquired programming skills in C, C++, Java, and python.

In several of my past projects, I have used classical MD to study protein-ligand binding interactions to understand the inhibitory mechanisms of medically important kinases. Currently, I am also exploring enhanced sampling techniques such as Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD) and supervised MD to study the activation mechanism of serotonin receptors. At this point in my career, I am interested to acquire expertise in advanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques of biomolecules.
