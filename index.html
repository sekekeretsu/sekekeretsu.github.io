"hello world" 
Thanks for this - it's the only way I could figure out what was wrong. 
When I re-created the branch, github then notified me that the problem was that a submodule couldn't be updated, so I removed it as a submodule and committed the files it contained instead. 
But it never gave me any errors before recreating the gh-pages branch, it just wouldn't update.
