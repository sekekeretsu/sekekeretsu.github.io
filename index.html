      <p>
        I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Immunology,
        National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland.
        Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Dalhousie University under the supervision of
        <strong>Dr. Shashi Gujar</strong> and <strong>Dr. Tobias Karakach</strong>.
        I also briefly served as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Cancer Mutation Research Center,
        Chosun University, South Korea.
      </p>

      <p>
        I earned my Master’s degree in Information Technology from the Department of Computer Science and
        Engineering at Tezpur University, where I applied data mining techniques to identify protein
        complexes in protein–protein interaction networks under the guidance of
        <strong>Prof. Rosy Sarmah</strong>.
        The outcomes of my graduate research were published in peer-reviewed journals and led to my
        doctoral training in South Korea.
        I completed my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at the Department of Biomedical Sciences,
        <a href="https://www3.chosun.ac.kr/eng/index.do">Chosun University</a>,
        under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Seung Joo Cho</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I have developed strong programming skills in R, C, C++, Java, and Python.
        I implemented several methods proposed in my Master’s dissertation using Java APIs;
        the corresponding software and executables are available
        <a href="https://sekekeretsu.github.io/software.html">here</a>.
        During my graduate and doctoral training, I gained extensive experience in data mining of
        protein–protein interaction networks and molecular modeling techniques, including protein
        modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, enhanced sampling methods,
        free-energy calculations, virtual screening, and linear modeling using 3D quantitative
        structure–activity relationship (3D-QSAR) analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my postdoctoral fellowship at Dalhousie University, I worked on collaborative projects
        involving RNA-sequencing and whole-exome/genome sequencing data from Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
        patients to identify genomic mutations and differentially expressed genes associated with MCL.
        This work included the identification and generation of MCL-specific and mutation-associated
        antigens through mutation analysis and epitope prediction and is ongoing in
        <strong>Dr. Shashi Gujar’s</strong> laboratory.
        I also contributed to an error-modeling project aimed at characterizing error structures in
        LC-MS/MS proteomics data.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my current role at the NIH, I apply bioinformatics approaches to study and characterize
        immune cell populations in glioblastoma.
